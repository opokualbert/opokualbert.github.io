            <p>As we watch soccer players exhibit their skills on the pitch at the world cup stage, we would think these players are healthy in all sense, given the amount of work they put in before and during each game. Health experts advise, exercising is paramount for avoiding many diseases. In that context, I wondered what is the impact of exercise on sports men and women, and in particular, soccer players.</p>

            <p>These questions cannot be answered for players currently playing in the game because I do not have access to their medical records so I decided to use a public data on Wikipedia which show the causes of death of soccer players on earth.</p>

            <p>I decided to make this more of a tutorial so I will share steps of the data acquisition through to the analysis. I wanted to find out the average age at death, and the causes of death of soccer players that have passed away.</p>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
